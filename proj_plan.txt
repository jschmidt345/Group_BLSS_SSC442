Using ML or linear regression:

- analyze relationship between key macro variables and economic growth

- independent variables : unemployment rate, cpi, t-bill rates + more

- dependent variable : end of year % change in GDP

- possibly base analysis around local or state level growth and macro conditions

- create multiple visualizations and models

- most likely use FRED as data source if we decide to not pursue local data

- possibly use PCA to determine which variables we will use
